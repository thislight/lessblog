# LessBlog
Less is Moooooore!  
Maybe it's most powerful blog generator of ALL WORLD.

## How to use
1. Install Dart SDK 1.24.3 -> https://dartlang.org
2. Clone this repo
3. Change the website infomation in `blog.json`
4. Run `pub get` in this directory (which had this file)
5. Do some editing in `lessblog.dart` (not `lib/lessblog.dart`)
6. Run `dart lessblog.dart` to compile your posts to website, if not error message there, its done
7. Your website will be in directory `public`
8. Write down your story in directory `posts`
9. If you want know how RenderEngine work (for create theme yourself), `lib/default.dart` is a good example
10. I don't know is dart 2 support it
11. All about post infomation will store in `posts.json`
